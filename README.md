# khwarizmi

A simple library for efficiently solving basic algebraic expressions.

## Brief intro

This library works in a similar way an interpreter does. Its singularity is that what it interprets is a special kind of language: **algebra**.  

It allows you to cast, from simple strings that represent equations, complex and rich mathematical objects, with their own attributes and properties. It's focused on efficiency and simplicity, and because of that it is easy to use, and implementing it represents no cost to the program.

## What can I do with it?

Khwarizmi began as an equation solver, and ended up being much more. Working with linear or quadratic equations, polynomials of all kinds, systems of equations and operations between very basic to highly complex algebraic terms and expressions. Apart from expressing, simplifying and solving polynomials and equations, it can graph any linear or quadratic expression on a cartesian coordinate system. 

For a highscool student, there's pretty much anything you can't do with Khwarizmi of what you've learned in school; more complex, college-level operations will be, and are being, introduced. If you use khwarizmi for some reason, expect updates oftenly.

If you want to see how Khwarizmi works, refer to /docs/sample_code.md on this repository, where you'll find some very simple examples of how khwarizmi looks like.


## Requirements

The only requirement for using the library are having **Python 3.x** and **matplotlib library** installed (the last is installed by default in most GNU/Linux distros so no problems there).

# Installation

To install the library for Python 3 use pip on your terminal.

    pip3 install khwarizmi --user

You are good to go now!
