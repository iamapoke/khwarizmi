# khwarizmi

A simple library for efficiently solving basic algebraic expressions.

## Brief intro

This library works in a similar way an interpreter does. Its singularity is that what it interprets is a special kind of language: **algebra**.  

By creating algebraic objects, through string representations of algebraic epxressions, Khwarizmi makes it easy to operate between multiple types of algebraic expressions. Each object carries a meaningful set of attributes and functions by itself, but there are many ways you can make expressions operate between themselves, and get the properties of the resultant expression as well!

Despite how rich this mathematical objects are, with their set of attributes and methods, they are incredibly unexpensive. Khwarizmi is focused on efficiency and simplicity, and because of that it's not just easy, but also cheap to implement.


## What can I do with it?

Khwarizmi began as an equation solver and ended up being so much more. The interpretation of linear and quadratic equations, polynomials of all kinds, systems of equations and operations between very basic to highly complex algebraic terms are featured. Apart from interpreting and manipulationg expressions, many kinds of equations and polynomials can be graphed on a cartesian coordinate system automatically.

For a highscool student, there's pretty much anything you can't do with Khwarizmi of what you've learned in school; more complex, college-level operations will be, and are being, introduced. If you use khwarizmi for some reason, expect updates oftenly.

If you want to see how Khwarizmi works, refer to /docs/sample_code.md on this repository, where you'll find some very simple examples of how khwarizmi looks like.


## Requirements

The only requirement for using the library are having **Python 3.x** and **matplotlib library** installed (the last is installed by default in most GNU/Linux distros so no problems there).

# Installation

To install the library for Python 3 use pip on your terminal.

    pip3 install khwarizmi --user

You are good to go now!
