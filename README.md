# khwarizmi-project
A library for solving quickly and efficiently algebraic expressions.

# How? 

This library works in a similar way an interpreter does. Its singularity is that what it interprets is a special kind of language: **algebra**. 

It works with classes because algebraic properties are more similar to attributes of a thing than to variables or mere information. To create an algebraic expression, you must only create an instance of the equation type that you wish (for example, a linear equation) and pass your equation (string) as an argument. For example:

    my_equation = Linear("y = 2x + 5")
    
Cool, uh?

# Cool things you can do with this library
